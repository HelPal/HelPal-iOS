/*
 * In a mobile app we always need to persist the data, otherwise all the data we need will be lost next time user launches his or her app
 * There are many ways to do persisting. Most easy one are implemented here. We only stored the key-value pair.
 * But as the app grows complex, you may need to use a database to store data and query it.
 * You can use Sqlite to do this. We have FMDB and other frameworks helping us maintain a Sqlite database in app.
 * However, in a real complex app, Sqlite will be another shit you don't want to step on. In this case you may need Realm or other REAL database frameworks.
 * And always, don't use CoreData.
